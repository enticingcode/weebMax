    How do I dynamically pull individual collection/models via request query?
    Should I just keep all products under same collection (that includes, new, upcoming, and art) meaning I would have to edit the master schema to hold even more infomration. it would eliminate repetitive schema on other objects. 
    Downside is, its all on one schema, creates clunkiness in all that info.
