    - So i have duplicated productID page onto both collections and product-category,
    need to consolidate this so there isn't double the work. Coming back after implementations of more dire things are in place

    -Image size inconsistencies need fixing

    - I might be doing unnecessary data fetching when going into product details page.
    Products are already pulled in when grid page is pulled, so maybe use data already present instead of fetching every single product.
